## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Week 1-2)
1. **Payment Integration** - Core revenue functionality
2. **Activity Logging** - Essential for analytics and user tracking

### Medium Priority (Week 3-4)  
3. **Webhook System** - Automation and integration capabilities
4. **Referral System** - Growth and user acquisition

---

## Technical Dependencies

### External Services
- **Cashfree**: Payment processing
- **n8n**: Workflow automation (webhook consumer)

### Database Migrations Needed
- Payment-related tables
- Enhanced activity logging structure
- Webhook configuration tables
- Referral rewards system

### Security Considerations
- Payment data encryption
- Webhook signature verification
- Rate limiting for all endpoints
- Audit trails for sensitive operations

---

## Next Development Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start with Cashfree payment integration
2. **Following**: Implement comprehensive activity logging
3. **Then**: Build webhook infrastructure for n8n
4. **Finally**: Complete referral system with rewards

Each phase includes proper testing, error handling, and documentation.
