# ðŸš€ Production Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Create Production Supabase Project

### Manual Steps (Required):
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Sign in to your account

2. **Create New Project:**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Choose organization
   - Enter project name: "RiderFlow Production"
   - Enter database password (save this!)
   - Select region closest to your users
   - Click "Create new project"

3. **Wait for Setup:**
   - Project creation takes 2-3 minutes
   - Note down the project URL and keys

4. **Get Production Credentials:**
   - Go to Settings â†’ API
   - Copy these 3 values:
     - **Project URL:** `https://your-prod-id.supabase.co`
     - **anon public key:** Long key starting with "eyJ"
     - **service_role key:** Different long key starting with "eyJ"

## Step 2: Configure Production Environment

### Update .env for Production:
```bash
# Replace with your production values
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-production-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key_here
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_production_service_role_key_here
```

## Step 3: Run Database Migrations

### Automatic Migration:
- All migrations will run automatically when you first access the app
- The database schema will be created exactly as in development
- All tables, RLS policies, and functions will be set up

### Verify Migration Success:
1. Check Supabase dashboard â†’ Table Editor
2. Verify these tables exist:
   - `users`
   - `riders` 
   - `partners`
   - `vendors`
   - `equipment_items`
   - `upload_history`
   - `rider_updates`
   - `audit_logs`
   - `notifications`
   - `vendor_installations`

## Step 4: Import Production Data

### Option A: Use Export Script (Recommended)
1. **Run export script:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/export-production-data.js
   ```

2. **Files created in `production-export/`:**
   - `riders_export.json` â†’ All rider data
   - `partners_export.json` â†’ All partner data
   - `vendors_export.json` â†’ All vendor data
   - `users_export.json` â†’ All user accounts
   - `equipment_export.json` â†’ All equipment items
   - `export_summary.json` â†’ Export statistics

3. **Import via Upload Interface:**
   - Convert JSON to CSV/Excel if needed
   - Use the app's upload interface
   - Upload riders data first
   - Then upload partners and vendors

### Option B: Direct Database Migration
```sql
-- Use pg_dump and pg_restore for large datasets
-- This requires database access credentials
```

## Step 5: Create Production Admin User

### First Login Setup:
1. **Access production app**
2. **Sign up with admin email**
3. **First user becomes Super Admin automatically**
4. **Create additional users via Users page**

### User Account Strategy:
```bash
# Production user roles:
- Super Admin: Full system access
- Admin: Data management, user creation
- Training Person: Training management only  
- Equipment Person: Installation/equipment only
- Vendor: Installation portal only
```

## Step 6: Deploy to Netlify

### Automatic Deployment:
- Click "Deploy" button in the interface
- Netlify deployment will be triggered automatically
- Build process handles production optimization
- Environment variables are configured automatically

### Manual Deployment (Alternative):
1. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Drag `dist` folder to Netlify
   - Or connect GitHub repository
   - Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
